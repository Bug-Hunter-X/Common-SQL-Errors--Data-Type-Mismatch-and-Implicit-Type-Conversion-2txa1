In SQL, a common error is using the wrong data type for a column. For example, trying to store a large amount of text in a VARCHAR(255) column will truncate the text, leading to data loss. Another error is using implicit type conversion which might lead to unexpected results. For instance, if you try to compare a numeric value with a string value, SQL will perform an implicit conversion that might lead to unexpected results.
```sql
-- Incorrect data type
CREATE TABLE employees (
  employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255),
  bio TEXT -- Should use TEXT for large text
);

-- Implicit type conversion
SELECT * FROM products WHERE price = '10'; -- Comparing a number with a string
```
